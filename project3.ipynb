      "1. **Increased Speed and Efficiency:** LLMs can process vast amounts of textual data significantly faster than a human coder. This allows researchers to analyze larger datasets and complete coding projects in a shorter timeframe, accelerating the research process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Improved Consistency and Reliability:**  Human coders can introduce bias and inconsistencies in their coding decisions. LLMs, trained on large datasets, can apply coding schemes more consistently, reducing inter-rater reliability issues and enhancing the objectivity of the analysis.  This leads to more robust and reproducible findings.\n",

Their ability to analyze language nuances and contextual information can uncover hidden themes and enrich the qualitative understanding of the data.\n",
